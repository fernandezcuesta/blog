Fast and easy way to live sharing the screen, useful during upgrades where the
activities are to be audited real-time.

The following 2 components are in place:

- [**Wemux**](https://github.com/zolrath/wemux) and
[**tmux**](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/), where the former makes the magic of
easily making the guests read-only.
- **OpenSSH** configured in such a way that guests are directly attached to an
existing `wemux` session (or disconnected otherwise).

##[**Wemux**](https://github.com/zolrath/wemux)

Assuming `tmux` is already configured and working in the system, we can just
install wemux (`wemux-git` in AUR). For the configuration we can either run
`wemux config` or edit `/etc/wemux/wemux.conf` file.

This is all I needed to change from the defaults:

```bash
host_list=(my_local_username)   # only my own user will be running in host mode
default_client_mode="mirror"    # all clients are attached read-only
```

##OpenSSH

Create a guest user and set OpenSSH up as follows:

```bash
# Ensure only public key authentication is allowed
$ sudo sed -E -i.bak 's/^#?(PasswordAuthentication|ChallengeResponseAuthentication).*$/\1 no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Create new guest user
$ sudo useradd -m guest
$ echo -e 'guestpassword\nguestpassword' | sudo passwd guest

# Create ssh key for guest
$ su - guest
$ mkdir .ssh
$ ssh-keygen -N MY_PASSPHRASE -f .ssh/guest-ssh-key
$ echo 'command="wemux",no-port-forwarding,no-x11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding ' > .ssh/authorized_keys 
$ cat .ssh/guest-ssh-key.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys
```

Now share keys to the other party over a secure channel.

#&lt;tl;dr&gt;

Or **much easier and more secure**, if the other party has a **github** account both
steps above can be shorten by using `github-auth` with a simple command:

```bash
gh-auth add --command="wemux client mirror" --users=GITHUB_USER_ID
```

This will add the userâ€™s keys straight to our `~/.ssh/authorized` keys and force
the connection matching the keys to attach as mirror clients to the existing
`wemux` session.

Removing the keys is even easier with:

```bash
gh-auth remove --users=GITHUB_USER_ID
```
